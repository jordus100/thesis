abstract = {Automated surveillance systems observe the environment utilizing cameras. The observed scenario is then analysed using motion detection, crowd behaviour, individual behaviour, interaction between individuals, crowds and their surrounding environment. These automatic systems accomplish multitude of tasks which include, detection, interpretation, understanding, recording and creating alarms based on the analysis. Till recent, studies have achieved enhanced monitoring performance along with avoiding possible human failures by manipulation of different features of these systems. This paper presents a comprehensive review of such video surveillance systems as well as the components used with them. The description of the architectures used is presented which follows the most required analyses in these systems. For the bigger picture and wholesome view of the system, existing surveillance systems were compared in terms of characteristics, advantages, and difficulties which are tabulated in this paper. Adding to this, future trends are discussed which charts a path into the upcoming research directions.}

abstract = {Within this survey an attempt is made to document the present status of video surveillance systems. The main components of a surveillance system are presented and studied thoroughly. Algorithms for image enhancement, object detection, object tracking, object recognition and item re-identification are presented. The most common modalities utilized by surveillance systems are discussed, putting emphasis on video, in terms of available resolutions and new imaging approaches, like High Dynamic Range video. The most important features and analytics are presented, along with the most common approaches for image / video quality enhancement. Distributed computational infrastructures are discussed (Cloud, Fog and Edge Computing), describing the advantages and disadvantages of each approach. The most important deep learning algorithms are presented, along with the smart analytics that they utilize. Augmented reality and the role it can play to a surveillance system is reported, just before discussing the challenges and the future trends of surveillance.}

abstract = {The advancement in recent technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI), computer vision (CV) and internet of things (IoT) extends to various areas, especially surveillance systems that require real-time facial recognition processing to ensure safety. In fact, mobile robots are widely used in surveillance systems to perform dangerous tasks that humans cannot. In this context, we propose a prototype of a low-cost mobile surveillance robot based on Raspberry PI 4 which can be integrated into any industrial area. This intelligent robot checks about the presence of intruder using IoT and face recognition technology. The system is equipped with passive infrared (PIR) sensor and camera to record live streaming video and photos, which are transmitted to the room control via IoT. Thanks to facial recognition algorithms, the system can distinguish between company personnel and intruders. Haar Cascade Classifier and LBPH (Local Binary Pattern Histogram) algorithm are used in image processing to detect and identify individuals. When a stranger is detected, alert notifications and email with captured image are sent to the room control via IoT. A web interface was developed to remotely control the designed robot via a WiFi connection. This application allows monitoring of a wide area and can improve the robot's perception system. Performance evaluations will be conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the face recognition algorithms used in this framework.}

abstract = {Pythons simplicity lets you become productive quickly, but this often means you arent using everything it has to offer. With this hands-on guide, youll learn how to write effective, idiomatic Python code by leveraging its bestand possibly most neglectedfeatures. Author Luciano Ramalho takes you through Pythons core language features and libraries, and shows you how to make your code shorter, faster, and more readable at the same time.Many experienced programmers try to bend Python to fit patterns they learned from other languages, and never discover Python features outside of their experience. With this book, those Python programmers will thoroughly learn how to become proficient in Python 3.This book covers:Python data model: understand how special methods are the key to the consistent behavior of objectsData structures: take full advantage of built-in types, and understand the text vs bytes duality in the Unicode ageFunctions as objects: view Python functions as first-class objects, and understand how this affects popular design patternsObject-oriented idioms: build classes by learning about references, mutability, interfaces, operator overloading, and multiple inheritanceControl flow: leverage context managers, generators, coroutines, and concurrency with the concurrent.futures and asyncio packagesMetaprogramming: understand how properties, attribute descriptors, class decorators, and metaclasses work}
